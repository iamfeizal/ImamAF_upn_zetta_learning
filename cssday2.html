            <p>
              The Pixel 7 and the Pixel 7 Pro are Google's flagship phones for
              2022. Announced somewhat unconventionally five months ahead of
              launch, the phones are finally going on sale today in many more
              locations around the world than previous Pixel launches.<br />
              The Pixel 7 series can be seen as a small evolutionary step over
              the Pixel 6 series, which was a major step forward for the Pixel
              brand. With the Pixel 7, Google is content with making smaller
              improvements across the board to further refine the Pixel 6
              formula into something with an even broader appeal. If that sounds
              familiar then yes, that has pretty much been the mantra for all
              major smartphone brands this year, and Google is no exception.

            <p>
              The best iPhone ever, version 2022, size XL - we have the iPhone
              14 Pro Max. The list of novelties this year includes the notch
              morphing into a pill, the introduction of an Always-On display,
              and an all-new primary camera - and while you can get all of that
              on the 14 Pro, the extra screen estate and longevity coupled with
              the Max's 'ultimate' status mean it has a market niche of its own.

              Nothing in iPadOS will challenge the M2, at least, nothing you'll
              realistically do on an iPad. The M2 overheated on a Macbook Air
              running macOS, where there are tasks and activities designed for
              Mac Pros and Macbook Pros that the regular, fanless M2 cannot
              handle without active cooling. Which it unfortunately lacks.

              The Note that isn't a Note, yet it may very well end up being the
              last Note - Samsung's Galaxy S22 Ultra has some big shoes to fill.
              Attempting to appeal to both productivity-focused stylus lovers
              and photography enthusiasts, the latest Ultra will either be the
              ultimate phone, period, or fall short for either group in some
              way. We're here to find out which one is it.
